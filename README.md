# What is HotKey??

HotKeys are easy to pick up and use, and has no dependencies. 
The following special keys can be used for shortcuts:
backspace, tab, clear, enter, return, esc, escape, space, up, down, left, right, home, end, pageup, pagedown, del, delete.

This repository uses Html, Javascript and Jquery to create a Hotkey applictaion.In this project, I have create 3 views Top View, Front View and Side View.

***Top View works on ctrl+up***

***Front View works on ctrl+down***

***Side View works on ctrl+left***

By selecting this hotkeys we can print the view name.This application will further modified or customised by giving function to respective view so that we can display the image of 
that view.
